### Aggregates and Pointer Arithmetic

One of the most common uses of pointers in C is referencing aggregate data.
Aggregate data is data composed of multiple elements grouped together because
they are somehow related. C supports two classes of aggregate data: structures
and arrays. (Unions, although similar to structures, are considered formally to be
in a class by themselves.)

typedef struct ListElmt_ {
    void *data;
    struct ListElmt_ *next;
} ListElmt;

Structures are not permitted to contain instances of themselves, but they
may contain pointers to instances of themselves

Arrays are sequences of homogeneous elements arranged consecutively in memory.
When an array identifier
occurs in an expression, C converts the array transparently into an unmodifiable
pointer that points to the arrayâ€™s first element.

### Pointers as Parameters to Functions

When defining a function that accepts a multidimensional array, all but the first
dimension must be specified so that pointer arithmetic can be performed when
elements are accessed, as shown in the following code:

int g(int a[][2]) {
    a[2][0] = 5;
    return 0;
}
